# Learning2Judge

**A Digital Learning Platform for Dressage Judges in Norway**

## Project Overview

Learning2Judge is a web application designed for current and aspiring dressage judges in Norway. The platform serves as a digital tool for practicing and improving their judging skills by scoring dressage performances. Users will log in, watch videos of dressage routines, and evaluate the exercises performed by horses and riders by assigning scores. Once completed, users can compare their evaluations with a reference score to refine their skills.

## Why Learning2Judge?

Currently, there is no digital solution in Norway that allows judges to practice dressage scoring. Judges must attend multiple in-person competitions or seminars to gain experience, which is often time-consuming and costlyâ€”especially for those living in rural areas. Learning2Judge addresses these challenges by offering:

- **Convenience:** Practice scoring anytime, anywhere.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Eliminate the need for frequent travel.
- **Standardization:** Establish a shared reference framework for dressage judging in Norway.

## Key Features

- **Video Library:** Access to videos of dressage routines for evaluation.
- **Scoring System:** Assign scores to different exercises performed in the routines.
- **Comparison Tool:** Review and compare your scores with reference scores.

Learning2Judge will revolutionize the way dressage judges in Norway develop their skills, making the process more accessible, efficient, and standardized.
